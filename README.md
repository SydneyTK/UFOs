## Overview of Project 
Dana is an data journalist who got to write a peice about UFO sightings. She was only provided a JavaScript file of recorded sightings. For each sighting details like the date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments from those that witnessed the sighting were provided. Her end result was not only a great article but an interactive website that allows readers to also reviews the recorded intances. She created a dynamic table to filter the sightings by some of thier conditions like: the date it occured, city, state, country and shape. 

## Results- How to Use the Search Filters 
After loading the webiste, find the filter options on the left hand side of the screen. Within the text boxes enter the filters you would like to apply. For formatting your input follow the prompts in light grey text. Filters can be applied one by one, and you will see the table adapts each time you press enter after the filter. Apply as many or as little filters as you want. When you are done hit the 'UFO Sightings' text in the top upper left, this button will clear your search filters. 
### Example
You are curious to know how many sightings were in California on January 1, 2010, and where the shape was just described as a light. Answer seven sightings will appear.

## Summary
One drawback of this website's design is how the search filters are fixed at one point on the screen. When you are formulating your initial search conditions and scrolling through all the data it would be more user friendly if they search boxes stayed fixed on your screen while you scrolled. In the furutre adding an input section for readers to input thier own sightings would be very cool and allow the dataset to grow. Another idea to grow the website in the future would be a seperate articles page where Dana can publish more of her own articles, but also link articles from other authors about UFO sightings.
